## What is GoodGifts?
GoodGifts is a web application where you can have wishlists with items that you want for your birthday, Christmas or any other kind of event involving gifts.

You can also view other people's wishlists in case you want to get inspiration for gift ideas, add your friends, and the most important feature: create gifts that everyone except the beneficiary can see. With this feature, other friend can avoid giving the same gift or in case that it's an expensive one, they can send an implication request to collaborate in the same gift.
